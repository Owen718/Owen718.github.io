## üëã About Me

I am Tian Ye, a PhD student at [ROAS Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/robotics-and-autonomous-systems/)@HKUST, Guangzhou. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Lei Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/indexlzhu/home) and [Prof. Kan, Ge Lin](https://repository.hkust.edu.hk/ir/AuthorProfile/kan-ge-lin). During my undergraduate studies, I had the honor of being supervised by and collaborating with **Prof. Erkang Chen** and **Prof. Yun Liu**. Previously, I worked closely with [Dr. Hongwei Yi](https://xyyhw.top/) (Head of Research@[Hedra](https://www.hedra.com/)) to explore and develop Foundational Video Generation Models (e.g., [Magic 1-For-1](https://magic-141.github.io/Magic-141/), [MagicInfinite](https://magicinfinite.github.io)).


## üî¨ Research Interests

- **AIGC Technology**: Supporting the art creation industry and digital asset generation through advances in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) technology.
- **Visual Quality**: Exploring visual challenges in photography to create images with superior quality.
