## 👋 About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at **HKUST(GZ)**, advised by **Prof. Lei Zhu** and **Prof. Kan, Ge Lin**. Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at **Hedra Inc.** My research is fueled by a core philosophy: **to deliver work that is either immediately deployable by the user community or foundational enough to inspire the field.** Guided by this goal, I strive to bridge the gap between academic innovation and industrial application. 

## 🔬 Research Experience
I have developed several SOTA generative models:
- **Industry Impact:** At Hedra, I co-developed the **MagicInfinite (Character-3)** model. This breakthrough in infinite talking video generation directly propelled the company to **$10M ARR** and secured **$32M in Series A funding**.
- **Community Utility:** I released **Meissonic**, the world's first High-Res. Non-AR model achieving SDXL-level performance, which has garnered broad community adoption.
- **Visual Frontiers:** I lead **UltraFlux** (pioneering Data-Model Co-Design for Native 4K generation) and **LucidFlux** (a universal restoration model that outperforms commercial tools like **Meitu SR**), pushing the limits of visual quality and fidelity.
